# In your console type `install.packages("tidyverse")`, `install.packages("here")`, `install.packages("janitor")`, `install.packages("ggplot2")` so that you have them on your computer

# Wilson's Data on Giraffes 
## This is for the Oakland Zoo 


```{r}
# Importing all the data 

data_gir <- read_csv(here::here("data", "Guest Perceptions Data All - Cleaned.csv" ))

# now we clean up the names so its easier to work with 

data_gir <- janitor::clean_names(data_gir) #now everything is in lower case 

# taking a look at our data 

summary(data_gir)

class(data_gir$p1)
```


### Getting the means of a few things 

```{r}
# creating a for loop that will go through the columns we want 

p_feelings <- data_gir %>% 
  data.frame("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4", "p5", "p6", "p7", "p8")

data_gir %>%  
  group_by(phase) %>% 
  summarize((across(where(is.numeric(), mean, na.rm = TRUE))))
